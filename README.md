## VESTIUM
By Daniel Bennett
## Description
Ever find a shirt in your closet but never know what pants go well with it? By using Vestium the virtual closet you can easily see what's in your closet and what would go with what. By selecting a shirt from the closet of clothes VESTIUM will select what will look good with that selection.
<br>VESTIUM uses a self created logic based off personally conducted research and running the logic by other people to create an actual logic that isn't just based of color theory.
